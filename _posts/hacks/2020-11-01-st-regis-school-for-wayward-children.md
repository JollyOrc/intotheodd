summary:
subtext1: "St. Regis's School for Wayward Children is a correctional boarding school located in Arkham, Massachusetts. Stately and ominous, the looming stone building emerges out of a dense old-growth pine forest. The intricate stonework and stately greenery tracing up the walls whisper of old money and exclusive education. The aesthetic of elite academia is broken only by the rusted bars over the windows and the tall, spike-topped fence that encircles the property."
subtext2: "You are students here, several months in to the school year. Recently several of your classmates have disappeared. Rumors circulate of disappearances from past years and you find you can't help but investigate the mysteries of this storied institution."
