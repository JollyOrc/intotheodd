summary: "Hit Dice Dungeons is a heavily Work In Progress RPG where your character is primarily represented by a single die, their Hit Die."
subtext1: "Hit Dice Dungeons is a heavily Work In Progress RPG where your character is primarily represented by a single die, their Hit Die."
subtext2: "Characters roll their Hit Die to avoid threats and accomplish risky tasks, but it also abstracts their "HP" or ability to avoid harm. As they weather damage their Hit Die will shrink in size until it fizzles entirely."
subtext3: "Features a quick resolution combat system that's simple to run but flexible enough to handle interesting and complex actions."
subtext4: "Heavily inspired by Eric Nieudan's Macchiato Monsters and Chris McDowall's Electric Bastionland (along with many other games)."
