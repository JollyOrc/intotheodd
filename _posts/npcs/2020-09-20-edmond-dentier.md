subtext1: "Edmond Dentier. This young theorician is defending the idea that Bastionland is round shaped, finite, and in fact, rotating in space as part of the living stars. Therefore, all humans must be aliens, and all aliens must be humans. He will collect any round shaped object as a form of research, trying to decypher them as if they were accurate maps of Bastionland."
