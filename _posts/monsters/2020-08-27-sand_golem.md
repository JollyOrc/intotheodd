name: Sand Golem
stats: 6 HP
subtext1: " • A walking sandstorm with the face of a man."
subtext2: " • Made of Sand: Sand Golem is immune to all standard attacks but takes d6 damage per bucket of liquid poured on it. High heat causes it to glass up, freezing it in place until it passes a STR test."
subtext3: " • Exit Light: Attacks do no damage, but test CHA or you fall asleep. Sleeping characters can be awoken with loud noises or a hearty slap (an unarmed attack)."
subtext4: " • Enter Night: If all of the party is knocked asleep by a Sand Golem they are transported to a shared dream. To reawake, the PCs must escape the dream."
