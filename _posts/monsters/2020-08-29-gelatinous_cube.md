name: Gelatinous Cube
summary: Giant, transparent ooze.
stats: 16 HP, 2 Armor, 14 STR, 3 DEX, 3 CHA
subtext1: " • Appears as hazy, wet air until the observer is dangerously close to the Cube. A chemical smell may betray its nature from further away. The Cube is attracted to noise and heat."
subtext2: " • Does not perform normal attacks. Anyone that the Cube moves over is engulfed unless they pass a DEX save to jump aside, assuming there is room to. Those engulfed lose d8 DEX each turn and d6 STR every hour as they are digested. They cannot free themselves but must be pulled from the Cube by other means. When the Cube takes Critical Damage, it collapses into a puddle of sticky ooze."
