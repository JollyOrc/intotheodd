subtext1: Big, stupid beasts that eat nearly anything they find. Much prefer dead food to alive. Can bark out a very limited vocabulary of common tongue but have little comprehension.
subtext2: Critical Damage: a target contracts filth fever unless they pass a STR save. If they fail, then for the next day they are violently ill and do not benefit from resting.
