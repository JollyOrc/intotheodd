name: Incandescent Huntsman
stats: 3 HP,  15 DEX
subtext1: " • Attracts prey with the promise of a warm light in and a stolen humanoid face in the dark."
subtext2: " • Likes to build draining nests close to power stations."
subtext3: " • On Critical Damage, injects glowing bulb eggs into your bloodstream. "
subtext4: " • Glowing Bulb Egg Infection: target now glows in the dark (brighter in high electric areas). While infected they are drawn (CHA negates) to touch high voltage objects like a moth towards bright lights. If killed while touching said object 2d4 Incandescent Huntsmanlings escape, all bearing the target's face. The eggs can be removed by aggressive degaussing (you'll need a specialist or a very big magnet) or by avoiding all things electrical for a span of two weeks."
