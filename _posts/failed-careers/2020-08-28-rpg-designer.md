| 1 HP: Blatant Plagiarism - Take a reinforced throwing glass and a rubberised practice bottle. You know how to throw things; if really pushed you can probably juggle.                                 |   |   |
| 2 HP: You kept injecting your personal politics into it - You can shut down any conversation and change the subject of any conversation to the merits of the gold standard without raising suspicion. |   |   |
| 3 HP: The rules were too complicated - Subtract your stats from 20. You now have to roll over the result to pass tests.                                                                               |   |   |
| 4 HP: Accidentally destroyed your only copy - Given enough time you can convince anyone that their dreams are pointless.                                                                              |   |   |
| 5 HP: Over promised on crowdfunding stretch goals - You gain flight and x-ray vision… five sessions from now.                                                                                         |   |   |
| 6 HP: It was actually really successful! - You are idolised by sentient creatures with less than 7 CHA.                                                                                               |   |   |                                                                                                                                       |   |   |
