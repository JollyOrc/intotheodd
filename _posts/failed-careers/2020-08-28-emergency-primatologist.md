| What Was Your Speciality?                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| £1 Gorillas, large and strong but respecting tradition - You're very good at appearing bigger and stronger than you really are. You can convincingly copy any form of ritualized combat, if you've witnessed it at least once. |
| £2 Gibbons, incredibly agile but solve most problems by screaming - You can scream very loudly. If something hoots (or screams) at you, you can hoot back louder.                                                              |
| £3 Bonobos, constantly lusty - If you want, you can be sexually appealing to any vaguely humanoid creature (bipedal, two arms, two legs, some sort of head)                                                                    |
| £4 Orangutans, unerringly calm - You can always keep a calm facade, regardless of your inner turmoil. You can also stretch your cheeks very far.                                                                               |
| £5 Baboons, vicious and answering only to violence - Your unarmed attacks deal d6 damage to fleshy targets. You can tear faces off on critical damage.                                                                         |
| £6 Macaques, with notoriously sticky fingers - You always subconsciously watch your interlocutors hands. They can't pickpocket from you or do anything similarly underhanded without you noticing.                             |

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 HP You were raised by apes (Species according to table above) - take a runty monkey brother (d6 nails and teeth, DEX 15, 4HP)                                |
| 2 HP Trained by a renowned explorer and zoologist - Take a safari outfit, including a pith helmet. It gives you an air of an upper-class gentleman adventurer. |
| 3 HP A shady correspondence course - Take a worthless, but impressive seeming diploma.                                                                         |
| 4 HP Years of observation in the field - Take a notebook full of excitable notes on primate behaviour.                                                         |
| 5 HP You made it up as you went along - Take a collection of scars, with stories to go along with them.                                                        |
| 6 HP Trained by a group of mischievous mock-apes - take a book titled "How to trick a monkey". All the pages are blank.                                        |
