| What were you bribed to fail at?                                                                                                |   |   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|
| 1£: Mugging - You are a master at faking injury and even death if needs be.                                                     |   |   |
| 2£: Debate - So long as no one was hurt, people are willing to accept any apology from you so long as you admit you were wrong. |   |   |
| 3£: Courtship - You can make anyone seem irresistibly attractive just by standing next to them.                                 |   |   |
| 4£: Using everyday products in a live action infomercial - You can break anything by touching it.                               |   |   |
| 5£: Squid Racing - You have a knack for slipping behind anyone who pursues you.                                                 |   |   |
| 6£: Auction Bidding - You know exactly how valuable an object is to anyone looking at it.                                       |   |   |

| What went wrong?                                                                                                                                                                                |   |   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|
| 1 HP: You were exposed as a fraud - Even when you fail at something, you can convince people you're capable of it.                                                                               |   |   |
| 2 HP: An entirely unforeseen misunderstanding - Once per game when conductor establishes a location or person, establish another one with a similar name that it could easily be mistaken for.   |   |   |
| 3 HP - You accidentally succeeded - You are relentlessly pursued by a hired assassin, thankfully they're also paid to fail and make another assassin look better. Still incredibly inconvenient. |   |   |
| 4 HP: Nothing, actually - Your former partner owes you a similar favour.                                                                                                                         |   |   |
| 5 HP: Everything, actually - You have been tarred and feathered.                                                                                                                                 |   |   |
| 6 HP: Your partner bailed at the last minute: You still thirst for failure, start every session deprived until you fail a roll or take attribute damage.                                         |   |   |

| An entirely ordinary bank: Other treasure hunters find you insufferably boring. |   |   |
