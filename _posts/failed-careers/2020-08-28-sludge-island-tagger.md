| What was your tagger pseudonym?            |
|--------------------------------------------|
| £1 Hans - You have comically oversized hands. |
| £2 Double - There's two of you. You're twins, or very similar looking friends. You mostly act as one person.  |
| £3 Tia - It took you a long time to get bored. Take a pair of cool sunglasses (double as reading glasses) and decades of experience in vandalism. |
| £4 Mosca - You've got a fly's head. Maybe you're a weird mockery or something. You can eat anything soft and organic, but it always looks gross. |
| £5 Uzzi - You're the size of a child, have an unusual skin color (like green) and a weird face. |
| £6 Ghost - You can squeeze through any gap you can fit your head in. |

| What did you do besides tagging?                                                                                                                |

| 1 HP Stole washing machines - if you can lift something you can carry it through any terrain at normal speed.                                   |
| 2 HP Grew zoom shrooms - take a dose of psychedelic mushrooms, you know how to grow more with some dirt and access to shady materials.          |
| 3 HP Made experimental music - take low-fi recording equipment. Recorded sounds are audibly different on playback.                              |
| 4 HP Breakdanced - You can headspin indefinitely                                                                                                |
| 5 HP Hunted banana slugs - You can always smell a mollusk in the same room as you (or in a ten meter radius if you're outside or in a big room) |
| 6 HP Smoked - Take a Ciggie-brand ashtray and lighter, half a pack of cigarettes, and a nicotine addiction.                                     |
